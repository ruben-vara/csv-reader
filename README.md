## What is this?

A browser extension.

It will transform raw `csv` data into a simple `html` table, and show it online in the same tab.

Available free for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/csv-reader/dnioinfbhmclclfdbcnlfgbojdpdicde) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/csv-reader/).

### What problem does this solve?

When quickly looking through csv data files online, you either have to:

- Open them with Excel, Numbers, etc.
- Try to skim through the data in its raw state.

_CSV Reader_ allows you to look at the data formatted as a table, so you can make decisions faster.

## Features

CSV Reader detects if the current tab is a `.csv` page (correctly most of the time).

It transforms the raw `csv` data into a table, nicely formatted so it's easy to scan (see images below).

It allows the user to input some settings:

| Feature         | Default | Type    | Result                                             |
| --------------- | ------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Separator       | `,`     | String  | New column when this value is found                |
| Title row       | `false` | Boolean | Use the first line as the table header             |
| Skip at the top | `0`     | Number  | Number of text lines to leave untouched at the top |
| Links in text   | `false` | Boolean | Look for links in data and make them clickable     |

## How to use

1. Install the extension (in [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/csv-reader/dnioinfbhmclclfdbcnlfgbojdpdicde) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/csv-reader/)).
2. Head to any `.csv` data page.
3. Click on the extension icon, fill the form:
   1. Choose the **separator**.
   2. Check if there is a **title row** for the data. This will format a header row in the table.
   3. Input the number of **lines to skip** at the top. Some csv pages have a few lines with info, we don't want to format those.
   4. Check if there are **links** in the data. They will be formatted as clickable links.
4. Done, enjoy the table!

### Example

Visit a `.csv` data file online. You can try [this csv sample dataset](https://rubenvara.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/csv/dataNov-2-2020.csv) or [this other example](http://www.fpmaj.gr.jp/iyaku/HB_20170227-20170305.csv).

Click on the **CSV Reader** extension icon.

In the popup, input the config options: separator, title row, etc. (In the example dataset, `|` (pipe) as the separator, and check the title line option)

## Some kind of roadmap

Some features I'd like to work on (help appreciated):

- [ ] Show **progress**: while the content is being processed, hide it and show a loading component.
- [x] Add option to just _rainbow-code_ csv (like the [vscode plugin](https://github.com/mechatroner/vscode_rainbow_csv)) instead of making a table.
- [ ] Try to stop .csv files from **downloading**, and instead open them in browser so thay can be converted.
- [ ] Add option to download csv file.
- [x] Add option to download file as JSON (when there is a title row).
- [ ] Redesign popup with new functions.
- [ ] Make columns **hideable**.
- [ ] Make table sortable by column.
- [ ] Detect if text _looks like a link_.
- [ ] Try to **auto-detect** separator.
- [ ] Add an initial check to see if content is _too big_. If it is, change the parse method to a lighter (but maybe less precise) one.
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts.
